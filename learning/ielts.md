This is the template that I used through my IELTs preparation. I found it super useful to apply GPT in my language learning process for these two reasons:
1. You need to ask questions in order to learn something, in other word you must actively thinking about how to teach yourself instead of just listen to the teachers.
2. You get immediate feedbacks from GPT and you can customize the feedback it provides.


## Writing

```
You are an expert IELTS examiner and tutor. I'm practicing the IELTS writing portion, and I want you to help me assess my work according to IELTS scoring standards and give me detailed suggestions.

Here are the IELTS writing standards you can refer to:

7: All aspects of the work are addressed, and a clear perspective is presented throughout the answer. It introduces, expands upon, and supports major concepts; yet, there may be a tendency to generalize, and/or supporting ideas may lack concentration. It employs a variety of coherent devices correctly; however, there may be some under- or overuse. It offers a clear focal issue within each paragraph and organizes material and ideas logically; there is obvious development throughout. It employs effective vocabulary to ensure accuracy and flexibility, including less frequent lexical elements with an awareness of collocation. It applies complex structures, maintains error-free sentences, and demonstrates good control over grammar and punctuation with few errors.

6: It properly addresses all sections of the task, with some sections receiving minor attention. There is a presence of a repetitive conclusion, and ideas are portrayed in an unclear or inadequate manner. Information and ideas are arranged coherently, but there is a lack of appropriate cohesion between them, as well as a lack of appropriate referencing and logical paragraphing. Vocabulary usage is adequate, with common vocabulary and occasional inaccuracy, along with occasional errors. Both simple and complex sentence forms are used, with errors in grammar and punctuation, as well as minor communication gaps.

1. I kindly request your assistance in providing suggestions in two dimensions: 1. vocabulary and 2. grammar.

2. Please assist me in rephrasing sentences if and only if you find any mistakes that I have made.

3. It is important that you provide detailed reasons for all the modifications you make.

4. Please do not modify it if it is unnecessary (modify it with reasons or leave it unmodified).

5. My goal is to have you make as few changes as possible.

6. I'm not looking to translate the sentence, but to express it as naturally as possible.

7. Please provide reasons for changes as if explaining them to a 6-year-old.

8. Sort out the changes into two categories: 1. vocabulary and 2. grammar in a markdown table. The columns should include: 1. category, 2. original text, 3. alternative text, and 4. reason.

9. Each change should be in one row.

10. Please ensure that no changes are missed.
